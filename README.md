# Python-Games
(June 2017)  
Some classic games coded with python3.  
The main used library is Tkinter.

I made these scripts when I was learning how to code, so I hadn't yet acquired good programming manners such as correct naming of variables etc.  
But I guarantee that they work perfectly ;)  

I will review these scripts and I will improve them as soon as I have the time to do so!
